  [Linear regression using scikitlearn](/regression)
  =================

  ![](regression/pic.png)
  1. Brought in the data set via quandl and cleaned it up to use features that provided valuable insight. I also created my own feature which i thought to be useful
  2. Split the data into training and testing where testing was 20% of the data
  3. Trained the Linear regression classifier provided in scikitlearn
  4. Plotted results
  5. Stored the model in a pickle file so i wouldn't have to retrain everytime i wanted to predict
  6. Modified the code to load in pickle file instead of retrain.

  <summary>Linear Regression from scratch</summary>

  [Linear regression from scratch](/regression_from_scratch)
  =================

  ![](regression_from_scratch/pic.png)

  1. Got the formulas for needed to find the gradient and intercept and coded a function for it
  2. Created 2 test arrays to use and plotted the data in matplotlib
  3. Plotted the regression line to see if it fit the data
  4. Coded a function for the coefficient of determination to see if our line fit the data well

  <summary>K Nearest Neighbors</summary>

  [KNN](/knn)
  =================

  1. Retrieved dataset from UCI database online
  2. Replaced all the empty columns with a fixed value
  3. Dropped the id column as it is not contributing any useful info to our algorithm
  4. Defined features and target variable
  5. Split the dataset into training and test set
  6. Ran the KNN classifier from scikitlearn
